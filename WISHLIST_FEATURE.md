## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Wishlist Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE wishlist (
    wishlist_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    product_id INT NOT NULL,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    notes TEXT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_credentials(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_user_product (user_id, product_id),
    INDEX idx_user (user_id),
    INDEX idx_product (product_id),
    INDEX idx_added_at (added_at)
);
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ **Foreign Keys**: Automatic cleanup when user or product is deleted
- ✅ **Unique Constraint**: Prevents duplicate entries (same user + product)
- ✅ **Indexes**: Optimized for fast queries on user_id, product_id, and added_at
- ✅ **Notes Field**: Optional field for users to add personal notes

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend (PHP)
```php
// Fetch wishlist items with product details
$wishlist_sql = "SELECT w.*, p.product_name, p.price, p.sku, 
                 p.stock_quantity, p.short_description, c.category_name,
                 (SELECT image_url FROM product_images 
                  WHERE product_id = p.product_id AND is_primary = 1 
                  LIMIT 1) as image_url
                 FROM wishlist w
                 JOIN products p ON w.product_id = p.product_id
                 LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
                 WHERE w.user_id = ? AND p.is_active = 1
                 ORDER BY w.added_at DESC";
```

### AJAX Handler (add-to-wishlist.php)
Supports three actions:
1. **add** - Add product to wishlist
2. **remove** - Remove product from wishlist
3. **check** - Check if product is in wishlist

Returns JSON response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Added to wishlist successfully!",
    "wishlist_count": 5
}
```

### Frontend Integration
The wishlist page is accessible via:
```
http://localhost/vita/client/index.php?page=wishlist
```

})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
    if (data.in_wishlist) {

});
```

## 📊 Dashboard Integration

The client dashboard now shows:
- Real-time wishlist count from database
- Wishlist stat card with gradient icon
- Quick link to view wishlist

Updated code in `client/pages/index.php`:
```php
// Get wishlist count
$wishlist_sql = "SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM wishlist WHERE user_id = ?";
$stmt = $conn->prepare($wishlist_sql);
$stmt->bind_param("i", $user_id);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
$wishlist_count = $result->fetch_assoc()['total'];
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Wishlist page shows error
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `install_wishlist.php` to create the table

### Issue: Images not showing
**Solution**: Check that image paths in database are relative (e.g., `images/products/product.jpg`)

### Issue: Can't add to wishlist
**Solution**: Ensure user is logged in and session is active

### Issue: Duplicate entry error
**Solution**: Product is already in wishlist (unique constraint working correctly)

---

## 📝 Notes

- The wishlist requires user authentication (must be logged in)
- Products are automatically removed if deleted from database (CASCADE)
- User's wishlist is cleared if user account is deleted (CASCADE)
- The unique constraint prevents duplicate entries
- All queries use prepared statements for security
- All outputs are escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS
